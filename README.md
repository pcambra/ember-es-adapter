# Ember-ES-Adapter
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/seanstar12/ember-es-adapter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/seanstar12/ember-es-adapter)
An adapter written for Elasticsearch and EmberJS.

#### TODO
 - [ ] Add all functionality to the Adapter
 - [ ] Blueprints
 - [ ] Finish up the AWS request signer
 - [ ] Figure out how to test the thing
 - [ ] Definitely more...

#### What's the point of this?
I'm building a 'static' blog written in Ember with an Elasticsearch backend.
This is one of the key aspects to the project.
