An adapter written for Elasticsearch and EmberJS.

#### Demo
[S3 Blog](http://ember-s3-blog-prod.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/), this shows just the basics. I'm still working on
getting the ember repo into a stable (credential-free) state.

#### TODO
 - [ ] Add all functionality to the Adapter
 - [ ] Blueprints
 - [ ] Finish up the AWS request signer
 - [ ] Figure out how to test the thing
 - [ ] Definitely more...

#### What's the point of this?
I'm building a 'static' blog written in Ember with an Elasticsearch backend.
This is one of the key aspects to the project.
